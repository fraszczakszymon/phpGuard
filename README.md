# phpGuard

A simple tool that executes tests for php files, which has changed. Searching files is based on @covers tag.

## Instalation

```
npm install [-g] phpguard
```

## Dependencies
```
watchr
commander
```

## Configuration

phpguard.config.json
``` json
{
  "baseNamespacePath": "src",
  "testTypes": {
    "fast": "phpunit --colors"
  },
  "defaultType": "fast",
  "delayBetweenTests": 500
}
```

Legend:

* __baseNamespace__ - Path where php files are stored, it should be defined to root of defined namespaces.
* __testTypes__ - Array with command that will be executed after running phpguard with --test (-t) flag, feel free to add your own commands (at the end of command are added paths to tests, that should be run).
* __defaultType__ - Default test type, that should be executed, when you are running phpguard without --test (-t) flag.
* __delayBetweenTests__ - Deley between running tests if files are changing frequently. Bugfix for issue when you are working on remote server (sometimes files saves twice, etc.), feel free to set it to 0 value.
